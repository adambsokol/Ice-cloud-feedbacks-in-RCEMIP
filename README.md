# Ice-cloud-feedbacks-in-RCEMIP
Data and code to accompany "Anvil cloud thinning implies greater climate sensitivity" by Sokol et al (2024)

Files:
 - rcemip_iwp-resolved_statistics.nc: contains all data derived from RCEMIP output needed to conduct the analysis in the paper and generate the figures
 - ecs_output.nc: consolidated output and statistics from the four runs of the Bayesian inference code for estimating ECS from Sherwood et al. (2020) 

A Jupyter notebook will be uploaded upon publication that provides code to generate the figures included in the manuscript as well as some other statistics.
