# Ice-cloud-feedbacks-in-RCEMIP
Data and code to accompany "Anvil cloud thinning implies greater climate sensitivity" by Sokol et al (2024)

The ./data directory contains:
 - rcemip_iwp-resolved_statistics.nc: contains all data derived from RCEMIP output needed to conduct the analysis in the paper
 - four output files from the equilibrium climate sensitivity assessment code from Sherwood et al. (2020).

A Jupyter notebook will be uploaded upon publication that provides code to generate the figures included in the manuscript as well as some other statistics.
